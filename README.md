# Regression_Pytorch
Regression_Torch
Use torch.nn for the whole task Make different versions of a simple (1, 2, 1 - Input, Hidden, Output Layers & RELU Activation for the Hidden Layer) Neural Network for linear regression using PyTorch.

Version 1: Each weight/bias should be defined and treated/updated individually and don't define any functions (no UDF)

Version 2: Define some functions - for initialization of weights/biases, for forward pass, for updating the values of weights/biases

Version 3: Define weights and biases in form of tensor vectors/matrices
